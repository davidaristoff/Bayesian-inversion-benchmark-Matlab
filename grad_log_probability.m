function grad_log_pi = grad_log_probability(m,z,dz,z_hat,sig,sig_pr)

%compute log likelihood: here dz is the gradient of z wrt m = log(theta)
grad_log_L = -dz'*(z-z_hat)/(sig^2);

%compute log prior
grad_log_pi_pr = -(m-sig^2)/(sig^2);

%compute log posterior
grad_log_pi = grad_log_L + grad_log_pi_pr;
